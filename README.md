This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Sanatan App - Hindu Mythology Knowledge

## What is "Sanatan"?

**"Sanatan"** (also "Sanatana") means **eternal, timeless, or everlasting**. **"Sanatan Dharma"** is the original name for what is commonly called "Hinduism" in the West - it translates to **"the eternal way"** or **"the eternal law"** - representing the timeless, universal principles that govern existence.

## What This App Is For

This app makes ancient Hindu wisdom accessible through modern technology. It presents **shlokas** (sacred verses) from timeless Hindu scriptures like:

- **Bhagavad Gita** - The divine song of Lord Krishna
- **Ramayana** - The epic journey of Lord Rama
- **Mahabharata** - The great epic of ancient India
- **Upanishads** - Philosophical texts exploring the nature of reality
- Other sacred Hindu texts

## The Purpose & Vision

This app serves several important purposes:

1. **Preserving Ancient Wisdom** - Bringing timeless teachings from thousands of years ago into the modern digital age
2. **Making Sacred Texts Accessible** - Presenting complex philosophical and spiritual concepts in an easy-to-understand, engaging format
3. **Daily Spiritual Learning** - Enabling users to discover and reflect on sacred verses through a simple, swipeable interface
4. **Bridging Tradition & Technology** - Connecting ancient wisdom with contemporary life through modern mobile technology
5. **Cultural Preservation** - Helping preserve and share the rich heritage of Sanatan Dharma with new generations

## What It Stands For

This app represents:
- **Accessibility** - Making ancient wisdom available to everyone, anywhere
- **Modern Engagement** - Using contemporary design and interaction patterns to make spiritual learning engaging
- **Daily Practice** - Encouraging regular reflection and learning through bite-sized, digestible content
- **Cultural Heritage** - Preserving and sharing the profound teachings of Sanatan Dharma

The swipeable card format transforms reading shlokas into a simple, beautiful daily practice - helping users explore, understand, and reflect on these eternal teachings in a way that fits modern life.

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
